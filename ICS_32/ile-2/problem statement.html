<!--<h3>General Rules</h3>-->
<p>
This in-lab programming exam is worth a total of 100 points.
It requires you to write a class that overloads some arithmetic
  and relational operators, as well other double-underscore methods:
  for example <b>__iter__</b>, <b>__getitem__</b>, and <b>__call__</b>.
You will have approximately 90 minutes to work on the exam, after logging in
  and setting up your computer (I estimate that taking about 10 minutes) and
  reading these instructions carefully (I estimate that taking about 10
  minutes: don't rush); you may write on/annotate these pages.
Finally, write, test, and debug the methods in your class; write these methods
  in the order given.
I have designed these methods so that none are necessary in the writing
  of later methods, although sometimes using previously written methods (if you
  wrote them correctly) can simplify the code.
<p>
We will test your methods only for correctness, using a <b>bsc.txt</b> file,
  a variant of the one included in the project download.
This means that your methods must define exactly the parameters specified in
  the descriptions below and must work on all the example arguments; your
  methods should also work on any other correct arguments too.
Each method will be tested independantly of the others.
To aid your writing and debugging of these methods
<ol>
  <li>Write clear, concise, and simple Python code.
  <li>Choose good names for parameters and local variables.
</ol>
You do not need to include any comments in your code, but feel free to
  add comments to aid yourself.
We will <b>not</b> grade on appropriateness of names, comments, or Python
  idioms: we will grade only on correctness.
You may also call extra <b>print</b> functions in your code or use the Eclipse
  Debugger to help you debug your code.
Please comment-out or remove these <b>print</b> statements before submitting
  your code for grading.
<p>
You may use any functions in the standard Python library as well as in the
  <b>goody</b> and <b>prompt</b> modules (which will be included in the project
  file you will download).
Documentation for the Python standard library and these modules will be
  available during the exam.
I have written all the standard import statements that I needed in the module
  in which you will write your methods; feel free to include other imports, or
  change the form of the included imports to be simpler to use.
<p>
If you are having problems with the operating system (logging on, downloading
  the correct files, accessing the Python documentation, submitting your
  work) or Eclipse (starting it, setting it up for Python, running Python
  scripts, running the Eclipse debugger, turning on line numbers) please talk
  to the staff as soon as possible.
We are trying to test only your programming ability, so we will help you with
  these other activities.
But we cannot help you understand, test, or debug your programming errors.
<p>
You should have a good understanding of the solution to Programming
  Assignments #1-#2 (in #1, pay close attention to Part 1 and Part 3); you
  should also have a good understanding of the
  material on Quiz #3 and Questions 1, 3, 4, and 5 on the Midterm exam.
The problem may involve using any of the standard Python data types:
  <b>dict</b>, <b>list</b>, <b>tuple</b>, and <b>set</b>.
You may need to know how to iterate over the <b>keys</b>, <b>values</b>, and
  <b>items</b> of dictionaries (possibly in a <b>sorted</b> order).
You may need to use <b>*args</b> as a parameter specification, to
  match any number of positional (non-named) arguments in a function call.
You may need to read input files.
You may need to know how to call the functions/methods
    <b>all</b>, <b>any</b>;
    <b>min</b>, <b>max</b>, <b>sum</b>;
    <b>join</b>, <b>split</b>;
    <b>sort</b>, <b>sorted</b>;
    <b>enumerate</b>, <b>zip</b>.
Finally, you may need to be able to write <b>__iter__</b> using a generator.
You are free to use or avoid various Python language features (e.g.,
  lambdas or comprehensions): do what is easiest for you, because we are
  grading only on whether your functions work correctly.

<h3>The Graph class (100 pts)</h3>
<p>
The <b>Graph</b> class is defined in the <b>graph.py</b> module.
The <b>Graph</b> class represents a graph consisting of <b>nodes</b> and
  directed <b>edges</b>.
Each <b>node</b> is a <b>str</b>, depicted in a circle.
Each <b>edge</b> is depicted as an <b>arrow</b> that connects its
  <b>origin node</b> (at the tail) to its <b>destination node</b> (at the head).
<p>
Examine the following graph.
<p>
<img src="images/il2graph.jpg">
<p>
Note that some nodes are purely <b>origin nodes</b> with only outgoing edges
  (<b>b</b>); some nodes are purely <b>destination nodes</b> with only
  incoming edges (<b>c</b>); some nodes are both (<b>a</b> and <b>d</b>);
  and some nodes are neither (<b>e</b>).
<p>
We represent a <b>Graph</b> as a <b>dict</b> that stores every <b>node</b> in
  the graph as a <b>key</b>; each <b>key node</b> is associated with a
  <b>2-list</b> that consists of two <b>set</b>s: the first <b>set</b> 
  contains all the <b>destination nodes</b> that the <b>key node</b> points to
  (using outgoing edges from the <b>key node</b>); the second <b>set</b>
  contains the <b>origin nodes</b> that point to that <b>key node</b> (using
  the incoming edges to the <b>key node</b>).
So, the <b>Graph</b> pictured above is represented by the following <b>dict</b>.
<b><pre>  {'a': [{'c','d'},  {'d'}        ],
   'b': [{'c','d'},  set()        ],
   'c': [set(),      {'a','b','d'}],
   'd': [{'a','c'},  {'a','b'}    ],
   'e': [set(),      set()        ]}</pre></b>
<p>
Recall that <b>set()</b> is an empty <b>set</b> (whereas <b>{}</b> is the empty
  <b>dict</b>).
Of course, this information would print on one line, and because its data
  structures are <b>dict</b>s and <b>set</b>s, their keys/value items can
  appear in any order.
<p>
<!---
I have written a <b>__str__</b> method for the <b>Graph</b> class that shows
  this <b>dict</b> more clearly.
If we printed this graph, its string representation would appear as
<b><pre>  Graph:
    a: ->c, <>d
    b: ->c, ->d
    c: <-a, <-b, <-d
    d: <>a, <-b, ->c
    e: </pre></b>
Here, for example, the line 
<b><pre>    d: <>a, <-b, ->c</pre></b> means
<ol>
<li><b>node d</b> is both an <b>destination/origin</b> from/to <b>node a</b>.
<li><b>node d</b> is a <b>destination</b> from <b>node b</b>.
<li><b>node d</b> is an <b>origin</b> to <b>node c</b>.
</ol>
This <b>__str__</b> method always alphabetize the <b>nodes</b> vertically
  (one per line) and its <b>origin/destination nodes</b> horizontally (all on
  the same line).
<p>
--->

<h3>Details</h3>
Define a class named <b>Graph</b> in a module named
      <b>graph.py</b>
<p>
<ol start="0">
<!---
<li>Note that the class already includes a correctly written <b>__str__</b>
      method illustrated above, which you may use for printing/debugging; or
      just print/interpret the <b>dict</b> as shown above.
    <p>
-->
<li>This class defines a trivial <b>__init__</b> method that just defines
      <b>self.edges = {}</b>, an initially empty <b>edges dict</b> that will
      ultimately store every <b>node name</b> and its associated <b>2-list</b>
      of <b>set</b>s.
    The methods you must write below will examine and/or manipulate
      this <b>self.edges</b> attribute.
<!---
    Use this definition unchanged to test the <b>__setitem__</b> and
      <b>__getitem__</b> methods you will write below in Steps 1 and 2;
      then extend the <b>__init__</b> method as specified in Step 3.
    <p>
    When writing each of the methods below, you may assume that the
      <b>edges dict</b> representing the <b>Graph</b> is always in the correct
      form.
--->
<p>
<li>Define a <b>__setitem__</b> method as follows (with <b>o</b>(rigin) and
     <b>d</b>(estination) parameters).
    In a nutshell, writing <b>g['a'] = 'b'</b> means that the <b>edges dict</b>
      should include an edge going from the <b>origin node a</b> to the
      <b>destination node b</b>.
    Specifically:
    <p>
    <ul>
    <li>If either the <b>o</b> or <b>d</b> parameter is not a <b>str</b>, 
          raise a <b>GraphError</b> exception.
    <p>
    <li>If both the <b>o</b> and <b>d</b> arguments are <b>str</b>s,
          consider <b>o</b> to be the <b>origin node</b> and <b>d</b> to
          be the <b>destination node</b>.
        <ol>
        <li>If either of these nodes are not already a <b>key</b> in the
              <b>edges dict</b>, put it into the <b>edges dict</b> as a
              <b>key</b> associated with a <b>2-list</b> containing two empty
              <b>set</b>s.
        <p>
        <li>Then, add the <b>edge</b> to the <b>edges dict</b> by updating the
              information assocated with each <b>key</b>:
            for <b>g['a'] = 'b'</b> add <b>node b</b> into the
              <b>destination node set</b> associated with <b>key node a</b>
              and also add <b>node a</b> into the <b>origin node set</b>
              associated with <b>key node b</b>.
        </ol>
   </ul>
   <p>
   For example, if <b>g</b> refers to the original <b>Graph</b> above, then
    <b>g['a'] = 'b'</b> would result in the following <b>edges dict</b>
<b><pre>  {'a': [{'b','c','d'},  {'d'}        ],
   'b': [{'c','d'},      {'a'}        ],
   'c': [set(),          {'a','b','d'}],
   'd': [{'a','c'},      {'a','b'}    ],
   'e': [set(),          set()        ]}</pre></b>
Note that <b>key node a</b>'s outgoing edge <b>set</b> now includes
 <b>node b</b> and <b>key node b</b>'s incoming edge <b>set</b> now includes
 <b>node a</b>.
<!---
The <b>str(g)</b> would now print as
<b><pre>
Graph:
  a: ->b, ->c, <>d
  b: <-a, ->c, ->d
  c: <-a, <-b, <-d
  d: <>a, <-b, ->c
  e:</pre></b>
--->
<p>

<li>Define a <b>__getitem__</b> method as follows (with <b>item</b> parameter).
<p>
    <ul>
    <li>If the <b>item</b> parameter is a <b>key node</b> in the <b>Graph</b>,
           treat it as an <b>origin node</b> and return the <b>set</b> of its
           <b>destination node</b>s.
    <p>
    <li>If the <b>item</b> parameter is a <b>2-tuple</b> (specifying
           an <b>origin node</b> and <b>destination node</b> pair) and both 
           <b>node</b>s are in the <b>Graph</b>, return a <b>bool</b> value
           indicating whether or not the  <b>destination node</b> is in the
           outgoing <b>node set</b> of the <b>origin node</b>.
    <p>
    <li>In any other case, raise a <b>GraphError</b> exception.
   </ul>
   <p>
   For example, if <b>g</b> refers to the original <b>Graph</b> above, then
     <b>g['a']</b> returns <b>{'c','d'}</b>.
   Also, <b>g['a','c']</b> returns <b>True</b> and <b>g['a','e']</b> returns
      <b>False</b>.
   <p>
   Note that writing <b>g['a','c']</b> is the same as writing 
     <b>g[('a','c')]</b>: Python turns the <b>'a','c'</b> in the <b>[]</b>
     brackets into a <b>2-tuple</b>.
<p>

<!---
<li>Redefine the <b>__init__</b> method to actually use its single <b>*args</b>
      parameter that matches zero or more arguments. Each argument is expected
      to be processed as follows.
      <p>
      <ul>
      <li>If the argument is a <b>str</b>, it specifies a <b>node name</b>.
          Ensure that <b>node name</b> is <b>key</b> already in the
            <b>edges dict</b>; if it is not, put it as a <b>key</b> associated
             with a <b>2-list</b> containing two empty <b>set</b>s.
      <p>
      <li>If the argument is <b>2-tuple</b> whose values are both <b>str</b>, it
            specifies an <b>edge</b> whose <b>origin node</b> is followed by its
            <b>destination node</b>.
          Use <b>__setitem__</b> to put the <b>edge</b> into the <b>Graph</b>.
          If implemented correctly, <b>__setitem__</b> will ensure that
          <ul>
          <li>Each <b>node</b> is a <b>key</b> in the <b>edges dict</b>:
               if either is not, it will be put in the <b>edges dict</b>
               associated with a <b>2-list</b> containing two empty <b>set</b>s.
          <li>The <b>edge</b> information will be added to the appropriate
               <b>set</b>s for both the <b>origin node</b> and
               <b>destination node</b>.
          </ul>
      <p>
      <li>Otherwise, raise the <b>GraphError</b> exception if any of the
            arguments isn't a single <b>str</b> or a <b>2-tuple</b> whose values
            are both <b>str</b>.
      </ul>
    <p>
    The original <b>Graph</b> above could be specified by
<b><pre>  Graph(('a','c'), ('a','d'), ('b','c'), ('b','d'), ('d','a'), ('d','c'), 'e')</pre></b>
    These arguments specify the 6 edges in the original graph above, and
    <b>node e</b>, which appears by itself, because it is neither an
      <b>origin node</b> nor <b>destination node</b> of any <b>edge</b>.
    It still must be included in the <b>Graph</b> and could appear ANYWHERE in
      the arguments (not just at the end).
<p>
    <b>IMPORTANT</b>: You <b>must</b> use the name <b>self.edges</b> (all
         lower-case) to store the <b>dict</b> constructed from the arguments.
    The name <b>self.edges</b> is used in <!--- the <b>__str__</b> method that
      I wrote and in --- most tests in the batch self-check file.
    Store <b>no other self</b> attributes; all the methods in the
       <b>Graph</b> class must process only this data structure.
    <p>
    Finally, the other <b>Graph</b> methods are testable without redefining the
       <b>__init__</b> method; they directly set the <b>self.edges</b>
       attribute to the correct <b>dict</b>.
<p>
--->
<!---
<li>Define a <b>__repr__</b> method that returns a string, which when
      passed to <b>eval</b> returns a newly constructed <b>Graph</b> with all
      the required <b>nodes</b> and <b>edges</b>.
    All <b>edges</b> should appear first, followed by any <b>node</b> in the
      <b>Graph</b> that is not a <b>destination</b> node.
    <p>
    The <b>Graph</b> example above, might (because the order of the keys/values
     in the graph  makes no difference) return the string.
     <b><pre>  "Graph(('a','b',1),('a','c',3),('b','a',2),('d','b',2),('d','c',1),'e')"</pre></b>
    <p>
    Hint: Separately compute a <b>list</b> of <b>str</b> for each
      3-<b>tuple</b> representing an edge, and another <b>list</b> of each
      <b>node</b>  that is not a <b>destination node</b>.
    Then combine the lists and join the <b>str</b>s.
--->
<p>    
<li>Define a <b>__len__</b> method that returns the number of <b>edges</b> in
      the <b>Graph</b>.
    Ensure that it counts each <b>edge</b> exactly once.
    For example the <b>len</b> of the original <b>Graph</b> above is <b>6</b>
      because it has <b>6</b> edges.
    <!--: <b>a</b> to <b>c</b>, <b>a</b> to <b>d</b>,
      <b>b</b> to <b>c</b>, <b>b</b> to <b>d</b>, <b>d</b> to <b>a</b>, and
      <b>d</b> to <b>c</b>).-->
<p>

<li>Define a <b>__call__</b> method as follows (with <b>d</b> parameter).
   <ul>
   <li>If the <b>d</b> parameter is a <b>key node</b> in the <b>Graph</b>,
         treat it as an <b>destination node</b> and return the <b>set</b> of its
         <b>origin node</b>s.
   <p>
   <li>In any other case, raise a <b>GraphError</b> exception.
   </ul>
   <p>
   For example, if <b>g</b> refers to the original <b>Graph</b> above, then
    <b>g('d')</b> returns <b>{'a','b'}</b>; <b>g('x')</b> raises an exception.
   <p>
   Note how <b>()</b> differs from <b>[]</b>:
     <b>g('d')</b> returns <b>{'a','b'}</b> treating <b>'d'</b> as a
       <b>destination node</b>, returning its <b>origin node set</b>.
     But <b>g['d']</b> (using <b>__getitem__</b>) returns <b>{'a','c'}</b>,
     treating <b>'d'</b> as an <b>origin node</b>, returning its
     <b>destination node set</b>.
<p>

<li>Define a <b>degree</b> method as follows (with a node name parameter
      <b>n</b>).
    If <b>n</b> is not in the <b>Graph</b> raise a <b>GraphError</b> exception.
    Otherwise return the number of edges (both outgoing and incoming) for 
      node name <b>n</b>.
    Hint: you may call the methods above, which implement <b>[]</b> and
       <b>()</b>.
    <p>
    For example, if <b>g</b> refers to the original <b>Graph</b> above, then
      <b>g.degree('a')</b> returns <b>3</b>;
      <b>g.degree('b')</b> returns <b>2</b>;
      <b>g.degree('c')</b> returns <b>3</b>;
      <b>g.degree('d')</b> returns <b>4</b>; and
      <b>g.degree('e')</b> returns <b>0</b>.
<p>
<br>
<li>Define a <b>__contains__</b> method as follows (with <b>item</b> parameter):
      the <b>in</b> operator returns whether or not <b>item</b> is in the
      <b>Graph</b>.
    <ul>
    <li>If the <b>item</b> parameter is a <b>str</b>, return <b>True</b> if it
          is a <b>node</b> in the <b>Graph</b>, otherwise <b>False</b>.
    <p>
    <li>If the <b>item</b> parameter is a <b>2-tuple</b> specifying an
          <b>origin node</b> and <b>destination node</b> that are in the
          <b>Graph</b>,
          return <b>True</b> when there is an <b>edge</b> in the <b>Graph</b>
          going from the <b>origin node</b> to the <b>destination node</b>,
          otherwise return <b>False</b>.
    <p>
    <li>Otherwise (if the <b>item</b> is anything else) return <b>False</b>.
    </ul>
    <p>
    This method never raises an exception.
    <p>
    For example, if <b>g</b> refers to the original <b>Graph</b> above, then
    <b>'a' in g</b> returns <b>True</b>, but
      <b>'x' in g</b> returns <b>False</b>;
    also, <b>('a','b') in g</b> returns <b>False</b>, but
      <b>('a','c') in g</b> returns <b>True</b>.
<p>

<li>Define an <b>__iter__</b> method so that each call to <b>next</b> produces
      a value that is a <b>2-tuple</b> repesenting an <b>edge</b> in the
      <b>Graph</b>: an <b>origin node</b> followed by one of its
      <b>destination node</b>s.
    The <b>origin node</b>s are produced in increasing order of their
      <b>degree</b> (how many edges, both incoming and outgoing, they have).
    And, if two nodes have the same <b>degree</b>, they should be produced in
      alphabetical order.
   The <b>destination node</b>s for each <b>origin node</b> should appear in
     alphabetical order.
    <p>
    For example, iterating over the original <b>Graph</b> above produces 6 
       values in the following order:
       <b>('b', 'c')</b>,
       <b>('b', 'd')</b>,
       <b>('a', 'c')</b>,
       <b>('a', 'd')</b>,
       <b>('d', 'a')</b>, and
       <b>('d', 'c')</b>.
      This is the ordering, because
        <b>node b</b> has <b>degree</b> 2, so it and its two destination nodes,
        appearing alphabetically, are first;
       <b>node a</b> has <b>degree</b> 3, so it and its two destination nodes,
         appearing alphabetically, are next;
       and finally <b>node d</b> has <b>degree</b> 4, so it and its two
         destination nodes, appearing alphabetically, are last.
<p>

<li>Define the <b>&lt;=</b> operator for comparing two <b>Graph</b>s.
    We define the meaning of <b>g1 <= g2</b> as <b>g1 is a subgraph of
      g2</b>, which means that
    <p>
    <ul>
    <li>all the <b>nodes</b> present in <b>g1</b> are present in <b>g2</b>, and
    <p>
    <li>all the <b>edge</b>s prsent in <b>g1</b> (<b>origin node</b>,
         <b>destination node</b>) are present in <b>g2</b>.
    </ul>
    <p>
    Trivially, for any <b>Graph g</b>, <b>g <= g</b> evaluates to <b>True</b>.
    <p>
    For example, the <b>Graph</b> below on the left is a subgraph of the
      <b>Graph</b> below on the right: every <b>node</b> and <b>edge</b> in the
       left <b>Graph</b> appears in the right <b>Graph</b>, which also has one
       more <b>node</b> and two more <b>edge</b>s.

    The following method is worth just 1 <b>extra credit</b> point.
       Do not solve it unless you have correctly written all the other

    I included this problem to test the programming speed/ability of the
       more advanced students.

<ol start = "9">
<li>Define a <b>__delitem__</b> method as follows (with <b>item</b> parameter).
    <p>
    <ol>
    <li>If the <b>item</b> parameter is a <b>2-tuple</b> specifying an
          <b>origin node</b> and a <b>destination node</b> that are both are in

          <b>del g['a','e']</b> would do nothing (there is no <b>edge</b> from
          <b>a</b> to <b>e</b>), but
          <b>del g['a','c']</b> would change the graph to the one below on the
          right,
          by deleting the <b>edge</b> going from the <b>origin node a</b> to
          the <b>destination node c</b>.
